# Development and Testing

## Prerequisites 

Below is not using the containerized versions so your environment needs the following:

- Go in version 1.6
- Python in version 2.7
- Node.js in version 5.10

In addition, I'm using [http](http://httpie.org) and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) below but you can use `curl` and `grep` as well, instead.

## Testing

You'll needs four terminals to run the MARVIN components.

    This is the MARVIN nanoservice [Calendar Proxy] in version 0.2.0 listening on port 9999
    Proxying the following calendar:
